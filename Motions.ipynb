The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina. Major boat \\npp - - \\nOne cubic foot per second is equivalent to about 646,000 gallons per day. Ten million gallons per day is equivalent to about \\n15.5 cubic feet per second. \\nSee North Carolina Drought Management Advisory Council, \\nhttp://www.ncdrought.org (visited June 6, 2007); South Carolina State Climatology Office, \\nhttp://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/Drought/ \\ndrought-current-info. php. ', 'landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the busi- nesses that run the marinas. \\nSee App. 23, 38. Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above. If the EMC grants the re- quest in virtually any form, South Carolina will have no choice but to take appropriate legal action to block \\nits \\nimplementation. \\nI look forward to hearing from you and to continued dis- cussions and cooperation.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

Lake Wylie Marina has operated continuously \\nas a \\nfamily owned business since 1975. \\n3. I was the Manager of the Lake Wylie Marina dur- ing the drought of 2002 (the \"Drought\") and am familiar with the impacts of the Drought on the operations and finances of the Lake Wylie Marina. \\n4. The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

STATE \\nOF NORTH CAROLINA, \\nDefendant. \\nAffidavit of Mr. Dale Herendeen Personally appeared before me Mr. Dale Herendeen, who being duly sworn, states under oath \\nthat: \\n1. I am employed by Bowater Incorporated (\"Bowa- \\ntern). \\n2. I am the Environmental Manager of Bowater\\'s Ca- \\ntawba Operation (the \"Catawba Plant\"), located on the Catawba River, Town of Catawba, York County, South Carolina. \\n3. I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e.

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina.

Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105. ', 'Indeed, this Court routinely \"appoint[s] a Special Mas- ter to develop the record\" when the record \\nas presented in an original action \\n\"is not sufficiently developed to permit [the Court] to address the merits.\" South Carolina \\nv. \\nRegan, 465 U.S. 367, 382 (1984) (plurality); see also United States \\nv.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

I am the Catawba Riverkeeper and the Executive Director of the \\nCatawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\"). \\n2. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit environ- mental organization. \\n3. 1 have been the Catawba Riverkeeper since 1998. \\n4. 1 received a Bachelors of Science from Clemson \\nUniversity in 1987. \\n5. The mission of the Foundation is to advocate for and secure \\nprotection and enhancement of the Catawba River, \\nits lakes, tributaries and watershed so that it will always \\nsustain the human and wildlife populations that depend on \\nit for life. \\n6. 1 am -personally familiar with the Catawba River from \\nits origins in the State of North Carolina until its \\nterminus in the State of South Carolina. ', \"7. The statements and opinions set forth'in this affi- davit are based on my experiences working \\nas the Ca- \\ntawba Riverkeeper, including participation in rulemaking and legislative processes, patrolling the river, studying and commenting on permits and developments proposed within the basin, reading studies, documents and other materials, and involvement in \\na variety of other matters that have an effect on the Catawba River and its environs, and the aquatic life \\nit supports. \\n8. Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e. Flows through nine counties in North Carolina and five counties in South Carolina f. \\nHas a total drainage area of 12,302.5 square kms g. Provides a drinking water supply for over \\n1.3 mil- lion people whose needs are projected to increase over 200% in the next 50 years h. Provides the energy to power 116,000 homes and the water to support over \\n8100MW of fossil and nuclear-fueled power plants 10. There \\nis an intricate set of dependencies on the \\nCatawbdWateree River system, all hinging upon the deli- cate balance of water use both now and in the future. Jobs, communities, industry, recreation, and the envi- ronment are \\nat stake. \", '11. The water flows of the Catawba River vary widely from season to season and year to year. For example, the United States Geological Survey has reported the follow- ing data for the Catawba River at their stream gauge lo- cated on the Catawba River Near Rock Hill, SC: \\n12. As Catawba Riverkeeper, \\nI meet with stake- holders, interested parties, and representatives of state agencies about issues of concern about the Catawba River. \\n13. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I have participated on behalf of the Foundation \\nas a stakeholder in the ongoing negotiations (the \"FERC Negotiations\") between Duke Power Company LLC, doing business \\nas Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (\"Duke\") and other stakeholders related to the renewal of various Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission (\"FERC\") licenses for various reservoirs located on the Catawba River \\nthat are held by Duke. 14. The FERC Negotiations resulted in certain agree- ments with regard to the FERC Licenses that are set forth in that certain Comprehensive Relicensing Agree- ment for the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project FERC Pro- ject No. 2232 effective \\nas of August 1, 2006 (the \"Relicens- \\ning Agreement\").

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina. Major boat \\npp - - \\nOne cubic foot per second is equivalent to about 646,000 gallons per day. Ten million gallons per day is equivalent to about \\n15.5 cubic feet per second. \\nSee North Carolina Drought Management Advisory Council, \\nhttp://www.ncdrought.org (visited June 6, 2007); South Carolina State Climatology Office, \\nhttp://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/Drought/ \\ndrought-current-info. php. ', 'landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the busi- nesses that run the marinas. \\nSee App. 23, 38. Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above. If the EMC grants the re- quest in virtually any form, South Carolina will have no choice but to take appropriate legal action to block \\nits \\nimplementation. \\nI look forward to hearing from you and to continued dis- cussions and cooperation.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

Lake Wylie Marina has operated continuously \\nas a \\nfamily owned business since 1975. \\n3. I was the Manager of the Lake Wylie Marina dur- ing the drought of 2002 (the \"Drought\") and am familiar with the impacts of the Drought on the operations and finances of the Lake Wylie Marina. \\n4. The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

STATE \\nOF NORTH CAROLINA, \\nDefendant. \\nAffidavit of Mr. Dale Herendeen Personally appeared before me Mr. Dale Herendeen, who being duly sworn, states under oath \\nthat: \\n1. I am employed by Bowater Incorporated (\"Bowa- \\ntern). \\n2. I am the Environmental Manager of Bowater\\'s Ca- \\ntawba Operation (the \"Catawba Plant\"), located on the Catawba River, Town of Catawba, York County, South Carolina. \\n3. I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e.

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina.

Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105. ', 'Indeed, this Court routinely \"appoint[s] a Special Mas- ter to develop the record\" when the record \\nas presented in an original action \\n\"is not sufficiently developed to permit [the Court] to address the merits.\" South Carolina \\nv. \\nRegan, 465 U.S. 367, 382 (1984) (plurality); see also United States \\nv.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

I am the Catawba Riverkeeper and the Executive Director of the \\nCatawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\"). \\n2. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit environ- mental organization. \\n3. 1 have been the Catawba Riverkeeper since 1998. \\n4. 1 received a Bachelors of Science from Clemson \\nUniversity in 1987. \\n5. The mission of the Foundation is to advocate for and secure \\nprotection and enhancement of the Catawba River, \\nits lakes, tributaries and watershed so that it will always \\nsustain the human and wildlife populations that depend on \\nit for life. \\n6. 1 am -personally familiar with the Catawba River from \\nits origins in the State of North Carolina until its \\nterminus in the State of South Carolina. ', \"7. The statements and opinions set forth'in this affi- davit are based on my experiences working \\nas the Ca- \\ntawba Riverkeeper, including participation in rulemaking and legislative processes, patrolling the river, studying and commenting on permits and developments proposed within the basin, reading studies, documents and other materials, and involvement in \\na variety of other matters that have an effect on the Catawba River and its environs, and the aquatic life \\nit supports. \\n8. Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e. Flows through nine counties in North Carolina and five counties in South Carolina f. \\nHas a total drainage area of 12,302.5 square kms g. Provides a drinking water supply for over \\n1.3 mil- lion people whose needs are projected to increase over 200% in the next 50 years h. Provides the energy to power 116,000 homes and the water to support over \\n8100MW of fossil and nuclear-fueled power plants 10. There \\nis an intricate set of dependencies on the \\nCatawbdWateree River system, all hinging upon the deli- cate balance of water use both now and in the future. Jobs, communities, industry, recreation, and the envi- ronment are \\nat stake. \", '11. The water flows of the Catawba River vary widely from season to season and year to year. For example, the United States Geological Survey has reported the follow- ing data for the Catawba River at their stream gauge lo- cated on the Catawba River Near Rock Hill, SC: \\n12. As Catawba Riverkeeper, \\nI meet with stake- holders, interested parties, and representatives of state agencies about issues of concern about the Catawba River. \\n13. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I have participated on behalf of the Foundation \\nas a stakeholder in the ongoing negotiations (the \"FERC Negotiations\") between Duke Power Company LLC, doing business \\nas Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (\"Duke\") and other stakeholders related to the renewal of various Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission (\"FERC\") licenses for various reservoirs located on the Catawba River \\nthat are held by Duke. 14. The FERC Negotiations resulted in certain agree- ments with regard to the FERC Licenses that are set forth in that certain Comprehensive Relicensing Agree- ment for the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project FERC Pro- ject No. 2232 effective \\nas of August 1, 2006 (the \"Relicens- \\ning Agreement\").

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina. Major boat \\npp - - \\nOne cubic foot per second is equivalent to about 646,000 gallons per day. Ten million gallons per day is equivalent to about \\n15.5 cubic feet per second. \\nSee North Carolina Drought Management Advisory Council, \\nhttp://www.ncdrought.org (visited June 6, 2007); South Carolina State Climatology Office, \\nhttp://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/Drought/ \\ndrought-current-info. php. ', 'landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the busi- nesses that run the marinas. \\nSee App. 23, 38. Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above. If the EMC grants the re- quest in virtually any form, South Carolina will have no choice but to take appropriate legal action to block \\nits \\nimplementation. \\nI look forward to hearing from you and to continued dis- cussions and cooperation.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

Lake Wylie Marina has operated continuously \\nas a \\nfamily owned business since 1975. \\n3. I was the Manager of the Lake Wylie Marina dur- ing the drought of 2002 (the \"Drought\") and am familiar with the impacts of the Drought on the operations and finances of the Lake Wylie Marina. \\n4. The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

STATE \\nOF NORTH CAROLINA, \\nDefendant. \\nAffidavit of Mr. Dale Herendeen Personally appeared before me Mr. Dale Herendeen, who being duly sworn, states under oath \\nthat: \\n1. I am employed by Bowater Incorporated (\"Bowa- \\ntern). \\n2. I am the Environmental Manager of Bowater\\'s Ca- \\ntawba Operation (the \"Catawba Plant\"), located on the Catawba River, Town of Catawba, York County, South Carolina. \\n3. I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e.

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina.

Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105. ', 'Indeed, this Court routinely \"appoint[s] a Special Mas- ter to develop the record\" when the record \\nas presented in an original action \\n\"is not sufficiently developed to permit [the Court] to address the merits.\" South Carolina \\nv. \\nRegan, 465 U.S. 367, 382 (1984) (plurality); see also United States \\nv.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

I am the Catawba Riverkeeper and the Executive Director of the \\nCatawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\"). \\n2. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit environ- mental organization. \\n3. 1 have been the Catawba Riverkeeper since 1998. \\n4. 1 received a Bachelors of Science from Clemson \\nUniversity in 1987. \\n5. The mission of the Foundation is to advocate for and secure \\nprotection and enhancement of the Catawba River, \\nits lakes, tributaries and watershed so that it will always \\nsustain the human and wildlife populations that depend on \\nit for life. \\n6. 1 am -personally familiar with the Catawba River from \\nits origins in the State of North Carolina until its \\nterminus in the State of South Carolina. ', \"7. The statements and opinions set forth'in this affi- davit are based on my experiences working \\nas the Ca- \\ntawba Riverkeeper, including participation in rulemaking and legislative processes, patrolling the river, studying and commenting on permits and developments proposed within the basin, reading studies, documents and other materials, and involvement in \\na variety of other matters that have an effect on the Catawba River and its environs, and the aquatic life \\nit supports. \\n8. Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e. Flows through nine counties in North Carolina and five counties in South Carolina f. \\nHas a total drainage area of 12,302.5 square kms g. Provides a drinking water supply for over \\n1.3 mil- lion people whose needs are projected to increase over 200% in the next 50 years h. Provides the energy to power 116,000 homes and the water to support over \\n8100MW of fossil and nuclear-fueled power plants 10. There \\nis an intricate set of dependencies on the \\nCatawbdWateree River system, all hinging upon the deli- cate balance of water use both now and in the future. Jobs, communities, industry, recreation, and the envi- ronment are \\nat stake. \", '11. The water flows of the Catawba River vary widely from season to season and year to year. For example, the United States Geological Survey has reported the follow- ing data for the Catawba River at their stream gauge lo- cated on the Catawba River Near Rock Hill, SC: \\n12. As Catawba Riverkeeper, \\nI meet with stake- holders, interested parties, and representatives of state agencies about issues of concern about the Catawba River. \\n13. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I have participated on behalf of the Foundation \\nas a stakeholder in the ongoing negotiations (the \"FERC Negotiations\") between Duke Power Company LLC, doing business \\nas Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (\"Duke\") and other stakeholders related to the renewal of various Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission (\"FERC\") licenses for various reservoirs located on the Catawba River \\nthat are held by Duke. 14. The FERC Negotiations resulted in certain agree- ments with regard to the FERC Licenses that are set forth in that certain Comprehensive Relicensing Agree- ment for the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project FERC Pro- ject No. 2232 effective \\nas of August 1, 2006 (the \"Relicens- \\ning Agreement\").

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina. Major boat \\npp - - \\nOne cubic foot per second is equivalent to about 646,000 gallons per day. Ten million gallons per day is equivalent to about \\n15.5 cubic feet per second. \\nSee North Carolina Drought Management Advisory Council, \\nhttp://www.ncdrought.org (visited June 6, 2007); South Carolina State Climatology Office, \\nhttp://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/Drought/ \\ndrought-current-info. php. ', 'landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the busi- nesses that run the marinas. \\nSee App. 23, 38. Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above. If the EMC grants the re- quest in virtually any form, South Carolina will have no choice but to take appropriate legal action to block \\nits \\nimplementation. \\nI look forward to hearing from you and to continued dis- cussions and cooperation.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

Lake Wylie Marina has operated continuously \\nas a \\nfamily owned business since 1975. \\n3. I was the Manager of the Lake Wylie Marina dur- ing the drought of 2002 (the \"Drought\") and am familiar with the impacts of the Drought on the operations and finances of the Lake Wylie Marina. \\n4. The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

STATE \\nOF NORTH CAROLINA, \\nDefendant. \\nAffidavit of Mr. Dale Herendeen Personally appeared before me Mr. Dale Herendeen, who being duly sworn, states under oath \\nthat: \\n1. I am employed by Bowater Incorporated (\"Bowa- \\ntern). \\n2. I am the Environmental Manager of Bowater\\'s Ca- \\ntawba Operation (the \"Catawba Plant\"), located on the Catawba River, Town of Catawba, York County, South Carolina. \\n3. I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e.

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina.

Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105. ', 'Indeed, this Court routinely \"appoint[s] a Special Mas- ter to develop the record\" when the record \\nas presented in an original action \\n\"is not sufficiently developed to permit [the Court] to address the merits.\" South Carolina \\nv. \\nRegan, 465 U.S. 367, 382 (1984) (plurality); see also United States \\nv.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

I am the Catawba Riverkeeper and the Executive Director of the \\nCatawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\"). \\n2. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit environ- mental organization. \\n3. 1 have been the Catawba Riverkeeper since 1998. \\n4. 1 received a Bachelors of Science from Clemson \\nUniversity in 1987. \\n5. The mission of the Foundation is to advocate for and secure \\nprotection and enhancement of the Catawba River, \\nits lakes, tributaries and watershed so that it will always \\nsustain the human and wildlife populations that depend on \\nit for life. \\n6. 1 am -personally familiar with the Catawba River from \\nits origins in the State of North Carolina until its \\nterminus in the State of South Carolina. ', \"7. The statements and opinions set forth'in this affi- davit are based on my experiences working \\nas the Ca- \\ntawba Riverkeeper, including participation in rulemaking and legislative processes, patrolling the river, studying and commenting on permits and developments proposed within the basin, reading studies, documents and other materials, and involvement in \\na variety of other matters that have an effect on the Catawba River and its environs, and the aquatic life \\nit supports. \\n8. Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e. Flows through nine counties in North Carolina and five counties in South Carolina f. \\nHas a total drainage area of 12,302.5 square kms g. Provides a drinking water supply for over \\n1.3 mil- lion people whose needs are projected to increase over 200% in the next 50 years h. Provides the energy to power 116,000 homes and the water to support over \\n8100MW of fossil and nuclear-fueled power plants 10. There \\nis an intricate set of dependencies on the \\nCatawbdWateree River system, all hinging upon the deli- cate balance of water use both now and in the future. Jobs, communities, industry, recreation, and the envi- ronment are \\nat stake. \", '11. The water flows of the Catawba River vary widely from season to season and year to year. For example, the United States Geological Survey has reported the follow- ing data for the Catawba River at their stream gauge lo- cated on the Catawba River Near Rock Hill, SC: \\n12. As Catawba Riverkeeper, \\nI meet with stake- holders, interested parties, and representatives of state agencies about issues of concern about the Catawba River. \\n13. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I have participated on behalf of the Foundation \\nas a stakeholder in the ongoing negotiations (the \"FERC Negotiations\") between Duke Power Company LLC, doing business \\nas Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (\"Duke\") and other stakeholders related to the renewal of various Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission (\"FERC\") licenses for various reservoirs located on the Catawba River \\nthat are held by Duke. 14. The FERC Negotiations resulted in certain agree- ments with regard to the FERC Licenses that are set forth in that certain Comprehensive Relicensing Agree- ment for the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project FERC Pro- ject No. 2232 effective \\nas of August 1, 2006 (the \"Relicens- \\ning Agreement\").

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina. Major boat \\npp - - \\nOne cubic foot per second is equivalent to about 646,000 gallons per day. Ten million gallons per day is equivalent to about \\n15.5 cubic feet per second. \\nSee North Carolina Drought Management Advisory Council, \\nhttp://www.ncdrought.org (visited June 6, 2007); South Carolina State Climatology Office, \\nhttp://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/Drought/ \\ndrought-current-info. php. ', 'landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the busi- nesses that run the marinas. \\nSee App. 23, 38. Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above. If the EMC grants the re- quest in virtually any form, South Carolina will have no choice but to take appropriate legal action to block \\nits \\nimplementation. \\nI look forward to hearing from you and to continued dis- cussions and cooperation.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

Lake Wylie Marina has operated continuously \\nas a \\nfamily owned business since 1975. \\n3. I was the Manager of the Lake Wylie Marina dur- ing the drought of 2002 (the \"Drought\") and am familiar with the impacts of the Drought on the operations and finances of the Lake Wylie Marina. \\n4. The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

STATE \\nOF NORTH CAROLINA, \\nDefendant. \\nAffidavit of Mr. Dale Herendeen Personally appeared before me Mr. Dale Herendeen, who being duly sworn, states under oath \\nthat: \\n1. I am employed by Bowater Incorporated (\"Bowa- \\ntern). \\n2. I am the Environmental Manager of Bowater\\'s Ca- \\ntawba Operation (the \"Catawba Plant\"), located on the Catawba River, Town of Catawba, York County, South Carolina. \\n3. I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e.

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina.

Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105. ', 'Indeed, this Court routinely \"appoint[s] a Special Mas- ter to develop the record\" when the record \\nas presented in an original action \\n\"is not sufficiently developed to permit [the Court] to address the merits.\" South Carolina \\nv. \\nRegan, 465 U.S. 367, 382 (1984) (plurality); see also United States \\nv.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

I am the Catawba Riverkeeper and the Executive Director of the \\nCatawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\"). \\n2. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit environ- mental organization. \\n3. 1 have been the Catawba Riverkeeper since 1998. \\n4. 1 received a Bachelors of Science from Clemson \\nUniversity in 1987. \\n5. The mission of the Foundation is to advocate for and secure \\nprotection and enhancement of the Catawba River, \\nits lakes, tributaries and watershed so that it will always \\nsustain the human and wildlife populations that depend on \\nit for life. \\n6. 1 am -personally familiar with the Catawba River from \\nits origins in the State of North Carolina until its \\nterminus in the State of South Carolina. ', \"7. The statements and opinions set forth'in this affi- davit are based on my experiences working \\nas the Ca- \\ntawba Riverkeeper, including participation in rulemaking and legislative processes, patrolling the river, studying and commenting on permits and developments proposed within the basin, reading studies, documents and other materials, and involvement in \\na variety of other matters that have an effect on the Catawba River and its environs, and the aquatic life \\nit supports. \\n8. Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e. Flows through nine counties in North Carolina and five counties in South Carolina f. \\nHas a total drainage area of 12,302.5 square kms g. Provides a drinking water supply for over \\n1.3 mil- lion people whose needs are projected to increase over 200% in the next 50 years h. Provides the energy to power 116,000 homes and the water to support over \\n8100MW of fossil and nuclear-fueled power plants 10. There \\nis an intricate set of dependencies on the \\nCatawbdWateree River system, all hinging upon the deli- cate balance of water use both now and in the future. Jobs, communities, industry, recreation, and the envi- ronment are \\nat stake. \", '11. The water flows of the Catawba River vary widely from season to season and year to year. For example, the United States Geological Survey has reported the follow- ing data for the Catawba River at their stream gauge lo- cated on the Catawba River Near Rock Hill, SC: \\n12. As Catawba Riverkeeper, \\nI meet with stake- holders, interested parties, and representatives of state agencies about issues of concern about the Catawba River. \\n13. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I have participated on behalf of the Foundation \\nas a stakeholder in the ongoing negotiations (the \"FERC Negotiations\") between Duke Power Company LLC, doing business \\nas Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (\"Duke\") and other stakeholders related to the renewal of various Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission (\"FERC\") licenses for various reservoirs located on the Catawba River \\nthat are held by Duke. 14. The FERC Negotiations resulted in certain agree- ments with regard to the FERC Licenses that are set forth in that certain Comprehensive Relicensing Agree- ment for the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project FERC Pro- ject No. 2232 effective \\nas of August 1, 2006 (the \"Relicens- \\ning Agreement\").

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina. Major boat \\npp - - \\nOne cubic foot per second is equivalent to about 646,000 gallons per day. Ten million gallons per day is equivalent to about \\n15.5 cubic feet per second. \\nSee North Carolina Drought Management Advisory Council, \\nhttp://www.ncdrought.org (visited June 6, 2007); South Carolina State Climatology Office, \\nhttp://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/Drought/ \\ndrought-current-info. php. ', 'landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the busi- nesses that run the marinas. \\nSee App. 23, 38. Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above. If the EMC grants the re- quest in virtually any form, South Carolina will have no choice but to take appropriate legal action to block \\nits \\nimplementation. \\nI look forward to hearing from you and to continued dis- cussions and cooperation.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

Lake Wylie Marina has operated continuously \\nas a \\nfamily owned business since 1975. \\n3. I was the Manager of the Lake Wylie Marina dur- ing the drought of 2002 (the \"Drought\") and am familiar with the impacts of the Drought on the operations and finances of the Lake Wylie Marina. \\n4. The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

STATE \\nOF NORTH CAROLINA, \\nDefendant. \\nAffidavit of Mr. Dale Herendeen Personally appeared before me Mr. Dale Herendeen, who being duly sworn, states under oath \\nthat: \\n1. I am employed by Bowater Incorporated (\"Bowa- \\ntern). \\n2. I am the Environmental Manager of Bowater\\'s Ca- \\ntawba Operation (the \"Catawba Plant\"), located on the Catawba River, Town of Catawba, York County, South Carolina. \\n3. I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e.

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

The Catawba River is an interstate river that originates \\nin the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - including Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - and unimpounded stretches for approximately \\n225 miles until it meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River in South Carolina. \\n2. The Catawba River is essential to the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and com- merce, and recreation in the area of South Carolina within the Catawba River Corridor and Basin. Yet the Catawba River \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level \\nthat can render its volume inadequate. The normal flow of the River has been significantly affected by severe droughts. Indeed, both North Carolina and South Carolina have issued drought advisory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declar- ing that moderate drought conditions exist. The most re- cent prior drought lasted from \\n1998 through 2002. ', '3. In 1991, North Carolina enacted an \"interbasin \\ntYlansfer statute\" that purports to authorize the transfer of large volumes of water from one river basin in North Carolina to another basin \\nin that State. Under that stat- ute, North Carolina has authorized the transfer of at least \\n48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin, with the most recent such transfer authorized in January 2007. \\n4. These past transfers - and threatened pending transfers - exceed North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the Catawba River. Because efforts at resolving this dis- pute through negotiation of an interstate compact have proved fruitless, South Carolina brings this Complaint for this Court to adjudicate the parties\\' dispute, to determine (with the assistance of a Special Master) the equitable apportionment of the Catawba River, and to enjoin North Carolina from authorizing past or future transfers incon- sistent with that apportionment. \\nPARTIES \\n5. The State of South Carolina brings this suit in its capacity as sovereign and as \\nparens patriae on behalf of its citizens. \\n6. The State of North Carolina has authorized inter- basin transfers from the Catawba River through an act of its legislature and the actions of a state agency, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission \\n(\"EMC\"), which is equivalent to the State itself for pur- poses of this Court\\'s jurisdiction. \\nJURISDICTION \\n7. The exclusive and original jurisdiction of this Court over controversies between two States is invoked under Article \\n111, 5 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States and \\n28 U.S.C. § 1251(a). This Court has long recognized that \\nit has \"a serious responsibility to ad- judicate cases where there are actual existing controver- sies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. California, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). ', 'THE CATAWBA RIVER BASIN \\n8. The Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina. The \\nmainstem of the River in North Carolina \\nis almost entirely impounded by a series of seven hydropower reservoirs running from Lake James, located \\nat the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to Lake Wylie, which extends across the state boundary with the State of North Carolina near Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n9. The Catawba River enters the State of South Caro- lina through Lake Wylie. Allison Creek flows into the \\nmidlake region of Lake Wylie within South Carolina. The Catawba River flows out of Lake Wylie and \\nis joined by Sugar Creek, Twelvemile Creek, and Cane Creek before draining into Fishing Creek Reservoir. The Catawba River flows out of Fishing Creek Reservoir and joins with Fishing Creek to flow into Great \\nFalls Reservoir. The River then joins with Camp Creek and Rocky Creek to form Cedar Creek Reservoir. Cedar Creek flows into the Catawba River just below the Cedar Creek Reservoir dam. The Catawba River joins Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River, which flows through Lake Wateree. Grannies Quarter Creek and Sawneys Creek flow into the Wateree River downstream of Lake Wateree. Twentyfive Mile Creek and Big Pine Tree Creek enter the Wateree River near the City of \\nCamden, followed by Swift Creek, Spears Creek, and Colonels Creek before merging with the Congaree River Basin to form the Santee River Basin. \\n10. The Catawba River Basin is the most densely populated river basin in the two \\nStates. That region in- cludes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North Carolina and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million people. The Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina includes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next decade. The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, in- cludes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most ', \"of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the \\nGastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. \\n11. The Catawba River serves a wide variety of North Carolina and South Carolina water-use purposes, includ- ing: aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric wa- ter use; industrial water use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelectric water use; and water supplies. \\n12. As the North Carolina Division of Water Quality noted in 1995, the water quality of the Catawba River may be jeopardized by growth in the surrounding area. As of that year, \\n16 percent of the Catawba River Basin's nearly 3,100 miles of free-flowing rivers and streams were considered impaired due to pollution. In that 1995 report, the North Carolina Division-identified eight major \\nwater- \\nquality issues in the Basin, which include: \\na) Nutrient inputs to lakes from both point and nonpoint sources; b) Sedimentation in streams and lakes from urban runoff, construction, and agriculture; c) Lack of assimilative capacity for \\noxygen- \\nconsuming wastes in streams and lake coves from wastewater treatment plant discharges; d) Stream water quality impairment from urban stormwater runoff; e) Health concerns associated with fecal coliform bacteria; \\nf) Toxicity from heavy metals and its impacts on aquatic life and water supplies; \\ng) Discharges of colored effluent from wastewater treatment plants; and h) Enforcement of water-quality regulations and compliance with discharge permits. \\n. \\n13. Of particular relevance to the current dispute, the North Carolina Division recognized that solving these problems \\nis beyond the capabilities of any one agency or \", 'group and that cooperative efforts between the various stakeholders in the Catawba River Basin will be neces- sary to protect the Basin\\'s water resources. 14. Such \\na multi-stakeholder negotiation process oc- curred recently, involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Duke Energy (which generates hydroelectric power from the Catawba River), and groups from South Carolina and North Carolina. Although more water may \\n\\' \\nbe necessary to sustain South Carolina\\'s needs, it was agreed through those negotiations \\nthat the minimum con- tinuous flow \\nthat South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River is 1,100 cubic feet per second - or about 71 \\n1 million gallons per day. See App. 15, 36-37. 15. The Catawba River, however, \\nis subject to severe periodic fluctuations in water level, and there are periods when the River does not have even minimally adequate flows. \\nSee App. 14-21. Indeed, a gauge that has long measured the daily flow of \\nthe Catawba River into South Carolina has found the average daily flow to be \\nas low as \\n132 cubic feet per second - or only about 85 million gal- lons per day. \\nSee- App. 16-17, 21. That gauge has re- corded average minimum daily flows \\nthat range from roughly 400 to 700 cubic feet per second nearly every day of the year. \\nSee id. Indeed, there are only two calendar days on which \\nthe minimum daily average flow recorded over \\na 64-year period has always been above 1,100 cubic feet per second. \\nSee id. \\n16. In addition, as part of the multi-stakeholder nego- tiation process discussed \\nin paragraph 14, Duke Energy developed \\na model to estimate the natural flow of the Ca- tawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that \\nthe Catawba River, even in its \"natural\" state, often would not deliver 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South\\' Carolina. \\nSee App. 15, 18, 36-37. From 1930 through 2002, \\nthat model estimates that the average daily flow would be below the 1,100 cubic feet per second on \\nat \\nleast one day of the year - and as many as 104 days (in ', '2002) - in 61 of those 72 years, and in 17 of the last 20. \\nSee App. 15, 18. \\n17. The Catawba River has also been subjected to pro- longed droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002; and \\nit is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions today. \\nSee App. 15. During the drought that ended in late 2002, South Carolina and its citizens suffered numerous harms, including: a) Major boat landings and public access areas were closed due to the low water levels, harming both the public and the businesses that run the marinas. \\n-See App. 23, 38. \\nb) Tap water was undrinkable in the City of Cam- \\nden, South Carolina. See App. 38. c) Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramatically the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric s ta- \\ntions located on the Catawba River. See id. \\nd) Businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs - more . \\nthan $6,000 per day - because the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater in amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38- \\n39. e) The flow in major tributaries of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only water flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee \\nApp. 39. ', 'NORTH CAROLINA\\'S UNLAWFUL AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSFERS FROM THE \\nCATAWBA RNER \\n18. The harms to South Carolina from reduced flow in the Catawba River have been exacerbated by the \\n\"inter- \\nbasin transfer statute\" that North Carolina enacted in \\n1991 and that applies by its express terms to the Catawba River. \\nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143-215.22G(l)(h). Any \"person\" wishing to \"transfer \\n. . . 2,000,000 gallons of wa- \\nter or more per day\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina EMC. See id. 5 143- \\n2 15.22I(a) (1) - (2): Transfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without regulation by the EMC. 19. The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of water transferred in the event of \\na drought or natural fluctuations in the flow of the Catawba River \\nthat limit the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. On the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply prob- lems\" \\nin North Carolina that are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a temporary transfer.\" Id. 5 143- \\n215.221(j). \\n20. The EMC has granted at least two permits under \\n5 143-215.221 that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River: a) In March 2002, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to \\n33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more \\nthan dou- ble the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previ- ously applied. This permit, moreover, was granted in the midst of the severe drought affecting the Catawba River from 1998 through 2002, and these inequitable withdrawals of water from the Catawba River neces- sarily exacerbated the harms \\nthat drought was impos- ing on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. ', \"b) In January 2007, the EMC granted the applica- tion by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to trans- fer up to \\n10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. The EMC granted that application over the objection of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities' application and the \\nEMC's environmental im- pact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River \\nin South Carolina. The EMC also approved the transfer despite the availability of alternative sources of water from other communities in North Carolina that stood ready, willing, and able to provide that water to the \\nC5ties of Concord and Kannapolis. \\n21. The statute also grandfathers the transfer by Union County of \\nat least 5 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin. In addition, pending before \\nthe \\nEMC is an application by Union County to increase by 13 \\nmillion gallons per day its transfers of water from the Ca- \\ntawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\n22. South Carolina does not know the extent to which the North Carolina statute has implicitly permitted one or more transfers of \\nless than 2 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. \\n23. South Carolina also does not know the extent to which entities within North Carolina have taken advan- tage of \\n5 143-215.22I(b), which authorizes transfers with- out a permit from the EMC up to the full capacity of any facility that was existing or under construction on July \\n1, \\n1993. \\n24. The transfers of water out of the Catawba River \\nthat the EMC has approved and the North Carolina stat- ute has permitted necessarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina. Such transfers ex- acerbate the existing natural conditions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina and cause the harms detailed above. Those transfers also \", 'are in excess of North Carolina\\'s equitable share of the \\nCatawba River. \\n25. North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer statute \"can- not be used\" to resolve this dispute, City of Milwaukee \\nv. \\nIllinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981), because, in \"inter- state water disputes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal system does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law,\" Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& 11-13 (1981). \\nNORTH CAROLINA\\'S REFUSAL TO AMELIORATE THE HARMS TO SOUTH CAROLINA \\n26. On October 31, 2006, South Carolina formally op- posed the request of the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That opposition expressly noted \\nthat the proposed transfer would both adversely affect \\nthe water quantity and quality in the South Carolina portion of the Catawba River and impair the affected South Carolina communities\\' ability to \\nsus- \\ntain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, to protect the local wildlife, and to ac- commodate recreation. See App. \\n1-6. \\n27. On December 19, 2006, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster wrote to North Carolina Attor- ney General Roy Cooper reiterating South Carolina\\'s op- position to the proposed transfer. South Carolina also proposed to North Carolina \\nthat the EMC suspend its on- going proceeding on the Cities\\' application while officials of North Carolina and South Carolina sought to negotiate \\nan interstate compact addressing this issue, along with other water issues. Attorney General McMaster noted \\nthat, because growth in the Southeast would likely lead to such questions arising with increasing frequency, an \\nin- \\nterstate compact would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. See App. 7-8. ', '28. On January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s \\n\"scheduled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Carolina Attorney General Cooper responded. In that letter, Attorney General Cooper stated \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources, but made no mention of negotiating \\nan interstate compact or delaying action on the Cities\\' application. \\nSee App. 9-10. The Cit- ies\\' application was granted on January 10, 2007. \\n29. In granting the application, the EMC also failed to heed \\na resolution of the CatawbaNVateree River Basin Bi- \\nState Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which in- cludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina. \\nSee App. 25. On January 8, 2007, the Commission had recommended that the EMC delay action on the Cities7 application for \\nat least six months to provide time for negotiation of an interstate compact to resolve the interstate dispute about the Cities7 proposed transfer. \\nSee App. 26-27, 29-30. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE, the State of South Carolina prays: \\n1. That the Court enter a decree declaring that the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute cannot be used to determine each State\\'s share of the Catawba River and equitably apportioning the Catawba River. 2. That the Court enter \\na decree enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River, past or future, inconsistent with that ap- portionment, and also declaring \\nthat the North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \\nis invalid to the extent that it \\nauthorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s equita- ble apportionment as determined by this Court\\'s decree. \\n3. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. ', 'DAVID C. FREDERICK \\nSCOTT H.

Both States histori- cally have relied on the Catawba River for hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recrea- tion in an area encompassing more than \\n1.5 million peo- ple and the Charlotte metropolitan area, which spans both States. Yet the flow of the Catawba River \\nis unreli- able and subject to scarcity in times of drought, most re- cently in \\n1998 through 2002, which created a crisis for South Carolinians dependent upon the River. Despite the history of shared use and benefit of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River, in 1991 North Carolina enacted a statute by which persons could transfer up to 2 million gallons of wa- ter per day out of the Catawba River Basin and into ba- \\nsins of other rivers in North Carolina, without the prior authorization of \\nthat State's officials. In addition, pursu- ant to that statute, North Carolina \\nhas affirmatively au- \\nthorized the transfer of at least 48 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to basins of other rivers \\nin \\nNorth Carolina. The most recent such transfer was au- thorized in January 2007, and \\na pending application seeks authority to transfer an additional \\n13 million gallons per day from the Catawba River. These past and threatened future transfers exceed North Carolina's equitable share of the Catawba River and directly harm South Carolina and \\nits citizens, severely reducing the flow of water avail- able for the generation of hydroelectric power, economic development and commerce, and recreation. South Carolina \\nhas attempted to resolve this dispute through negotiations and establishment of an interstate compact, but North Carolina has not been receptive to such efforts and, instead, has continued to authorize di- versions from the Catawba River. South Carolina, there- fore, \\nhas no means of preventing and undoing North Caro- lina's unlawful appropriation of the waters of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River other than invocation of this Court's original \", 'jurisdiction. South Carolina, therefore, seeks leave to file a complaint, in which \\nit seeks an equitable apportionment of the Catawba River and an order both enjoining North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the River inconsistent with that apportionment and preempt- ing North Carolina\\'s transfer statute to the extent \\nit pur- ports to authorize such transfers. \\nJURISDICTION \\nThis case, involving a dispute between two sovereign \\nStates1 over an interstate river, falls squarely within this Court\\'s exclusive and original jurisdiction over controver- sies between two States under Article \\n111, § 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \\n5 1251(a). \\nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that it has \"a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where there are actual existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States.\" Arizona \\nv. \\nCaZifornia, 373 U.S. 546, 564 (1963). \\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nArticle 111, 5 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitu- tion provides in relevant part: The judicial Power shall extend \\n. . . to Controver- sies between two or more States[.] Section \\n1251(a) of Title 28, United States Code, provides: The Supreme Court shall have original and exclu- sive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States. Sections \\n143-215.226: and 143-215.221 of the General Statutes of North Carolina are reproduced \\nat App. 43-52. \\nAn agency of the State is the State itself for purposes of original jurisdiction. \\nSee Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370-71 (1953). ', 'STATEMENT OF THE CASE \\nA. The Catawba River \\nThe Catawba River originates in the mountains of North Carolina and flows through a series of lakes - in- cluding Lake Wylie, where \\nit enters South Carolina - \\nand unimpounded stretches for approximately 225 miles until \\nit meets Big Wateree Creek to form the Wateree River. See Compl. \\n7 1. The Catawba River has long been viewed \\nas important to both South Carolina and North Carolina. In 178 7, recognizing the possibilities for the River\\'s development, the South Carolina legislature estab- lished a company to open the River \"from the North Caro- lina line to the \\nCamden Ferry, by means of canals, dams and locks.\" VII The Statutes at Large of South Carolina 549 (David \\nJ. McCord ed., 1840). North Carolina likewise established \\na \"private company . . . to improve the Ca- \\ntawba for navigation.\" Jones v. Duke Power Co., 501 F. \\nSupp. 713, 718 (W.D.N.C. 1980), aff\\'d, 672 F.2d 910 (4th Cir. 1981) (table). These efforts ultimately proved unsuc- cessful, due in part to the \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" of the River and \\nits \"inadequate water vol- ume \\nat ordinary stages,\" which \"rendered the river unfit for navigation in \\nits natural state and an unworthy can- didate for improvements to make \\nit fit for navigation in \\nthe future.\" Id. at 717. Despite these setbacks, \\nit would soon be realized that the Catawba River\\'s future in enhancing progress \\nin the Carolinas lay not in making the River navigable in the nineteenth century, but in harnessing its potential for electrical power in the twentieth. Beginning \\nin the 1890s - an era in which textile mills began to flourish through- out the South - a company, later known as Duke Power (now Duke Energy), was founded. That company came into being principally to provide power to the Piedmont\\'s fledgling cotton mills. Today, Duke Energy owns and op- erates a system of \\n11 reservoirs - six in North Carolina, four in South Carolina, and one \\nin Lake Wylie, on the border of the two States - in the Catawba-Wateree ', 'Basin, which provides hydroelectric power to the region. \\nSee App. 14. \\nThat region includes the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes both North and South Carolina and \\nis home to nearly 1.6 million peo- \\nple.Vhe Catawba River Corridor in South Carolina in- cludes York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties, contains nearly 300,000 people, and \\nis expected to have significant growth over the next \\nde~ade.~ The Catawba River Basin, which bisects the north-central portion of South Carolina, includes portions of eight South Carolina counties \\n- most of Chester, Kershaw, Lancaster, and York Counties, the eastern third of Fairfield County, and portions of Sumter, Lee, and \\nRichland Counties. The Catawba River \\nis key to the economic development of these portions of South Carolina, a historically under- developed area, and currently supports a number of major industries, including Bowater, Inc., Tyco Electronics, Inc., Springs Global US, Inc., and Celanese Advanced Materi- als, Inc. Indeed, the Catawba River Basin \\nis today the fastest growing sub-region \\njn the Carolinas, and the River serves \\na wide variety of North Carolina and South Caro- lina water-use purposes, including aquaculture; golf course irrigation; hydroelectric water use; industrial wa- ter use; irrigation water use; mining process; thermoelec- tric water use; and water supplies. The River now pro- vides drinking water for and receives waste discharges from 14 counties, \\n22 municipalities and two States - \\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. The same \"severe periodic fluctuations in water level\" and \"inadequate water volume at ordinary stages\" that rendered the Catawba River unfit for navigation, \\nDuke \\nPower, 501 F. Supp. at 717, however, continue today. A \\nSee http:llwww.census.gov/population/estimates/metro~generd/ \\n2006lCBSA-EST2006-al1data.c~~. \\n.

', 'streamflow gauge has been in operation from 1942 to the present below Lake Wylie, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary and \\nis where the Ca- \\ntawba River enters South Carolina. See App. 15-16. Measurements taken from that gauge show \\nthat the daily flow of the Catawba River into South Carolina has fluctu- ated widely and \\nhas been as low as 132 cubic feet per sec- ond (January 7, \\n200Z).4 See App. 16-17, 21; see also App. 20 (showing daily average flows for the entire year 2001, which ranged from nearly 7,000 cubic feet per second to less than 250 cubic feet per second). Further evidence comes from \\na model that Duke Energy developed during proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission to estimate the natural flow of the Catawba River, \\nas if the lakes used to generate hydroelectric power were not there. \\nSee App. 15. Those data show that the Catawba River, even in \\nits \"natural\" state, often would not deliver the 1,100 cubic feet per second of water into South Carolina \\nthat a negotiated process involving Duke Energy and groups from South Carolina and North Caro- lina agreed was the minimum continuous flow that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba. \\nSee App. 15, 18; \\nsee also App. 36-37. In addition, the Catawba River has been subjected to prolonged droughts in the \\nmid-1950s, the late 1980s, and from 1998 through 2002. \\nSee App. 15. Both North Caro- lina and South Carolina have recently issued drought ad- visory warnings for the Catawba River Basin, with both States currently declaring \\nthat moderate drought condi- tions \\nexist.5 The effects of the drought that ended in 2002 were particularly severe on South Carolina.

Tap water was undrinkable in the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina. \\nSee App. 38. Duke Energy was forced to reduce dramati- cally the generation of electricity from \\nits hydroelectric stations located on the River. \\nSee id. And businesses, such as the Bowater pulp and paper mill, were forced to incur significant costs \\n- more than $6,000 per day - be- cause the water flow was no longer sufficient to assimilate treated wastewater \\nin amounts allowed by state permits. \\nSee App. 32-33, 38-39. Indeed, the flow in major tributar- ies of the Catawba River was so reduced that the only wa- ter flowing was the discharge from wastewater treatment plants. \\nSee App. 39. \\nB. The North Carolina Interbasin Transfer Statute \\nIn 1991, North Carolina enacted a statute governing transfers of water - that is, the \"withdrawal, diversion, or pumping of surface water from one river basin and dis- charge of all or any part of the water in \\narnother] river basin.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \\n5 143-215.22G(3). The statute applies to \\na large number of enumerated rivers, including the Catawba River. \\nSee id. 9 143-215.22G(l)(h). \\nAny \"person\" wishing to \"transfer . . . 2,000,000 gallons of water or more per \\nday\" from a river basin must obtain a \\npermit from the North Carolina Environmental Manage- ment Commission \\n(\"EMC\"). Id. § 143-215.22I(a)(l)-(2). \\nTransfers of less than 2 million gallons of water per day are implicitly authorized to occur without the \\nEMC\\'s prior approval. The statute also grandfathers both previously approved certificates for transfer and pre-existing \\nwater- \\ntransfer facilities, which may increase their transfers up to their full capacity without obtaining approval from the EMC. \\nSee id. 5 143-215.22I(b), (i). The North Carolina statute prescribes \\na number of fac- tors \\nthat the EMC must consider in granting a permit, all of which on their face pertain only to North Carolina\\'s interests. Thus, the EMC \\nis directed to consider, among ', 'other things, the \"necessity, reasonableness, and benefi- cial effects\" of the \"proposed uses\" of the transferred water and the possible \"detrimental effects on\" the \"source river basin\" and the \"receiving river basin\" in North Carolina. \\nId. § 143-215.22I(f). The North Carolina statute contains no provisions requiring \\na reduction in the amount of wa- ter transferred in the event of a drought \\nthat limits the water available to downstream users in South Carolina. \\n. \\nOn the contrary, the statute allows the EMC to remedy \"water supply problems\" in North Carolina \\nthat are \"caused by drought\" by \\n\"grant[ing] approval for a tempo- rary transfer.\" \\nId. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThe EMC has granted at least two permits that have resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. For example, in March 2002, the EMC granted the application by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Utilities to transfer up to 33 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin, more than double the 16 million gallons per day limit \\nthat had previously applied. See \\nCompl. 7 20(a). In January 2007, the EMC granted the application by the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis to transfer up to 10 million gallons per day from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. \\n7 2003). The EMC granted this application over the objec- tion of South Carolina, which noted, among other things, that the Cities\\' application and the \\nEMC\\'s environmental impact statement gave no consideration to the effects of the transfer on uses of the Catawba River in South Caro- lina. \\nSee id. Pending before the EMC is an application by Union County to increase by \\n13 million gallons per day its \\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River Basin to the Rocky River Basin. \\nSee id. 7 21.6 \\nIn 1989, the South Carolina Water Resources Commission had, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated \\n§§ 49-21-10 et seq., au- thorized both Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Union County, North \\nCarolin\\'a - which jointly own a water treatment plant located in South Carolina on Lake Wylie, from which both counties derive their ', 'Those transfers of water out of the Catawba River nec- essarily reduce the amount of water available to flow into South Carolina, exacerbate the existing natural condi- tions and droughts that contribute to low flow conditions in South Carolina, and cause the harms detailed above. \\nC. Events Leading To This Dispute \\nAs noted above, South Carolina actively opposed the most recent application for \\na grant of authority to transfer water out of the Catawba River. In December 2006, Henry \\nMcMaster, the South Carolina Attorney General, wrote to his North Carolina counterpart, Roy Cooper, re- iterating South Carolina\\'s opposition to the Cities\\' appli- cation, as also expressed by Governor Mark Sanford and South Carolina\\'s members of Congress. \\nSee App. 7. At- torney General McMaster noted that, while litigation in this Court was an option, South Carolina\\'s preferred op- tion was to have the officials of the two States negotiate \\nan interstate compact, with the EMC staying its hand pending the outcome of those negotiations. \\nSee App. 7-8. \\nOn January 3, 2007 - one week before the EMC\\'s sched- uled resolution of the Cities\\' application - North Caro- lina Attorney General Cooper responded \\nthat he had for- warded the letter to Governor Mark Easley and the North Carolina Secretary for Human Resources. \\nSee App. 9-10. The response made no mention of any willingness to nego- tiate an interstate compact or to delay action on the Cities\\' application. On January 8, 2007, the \\nCatawba/Wateree River Basin Bi-State Advisory Commission (\"Commission\"), which \\nin- \\ncludes elected state officials from both South Carolina and North Carolina, passed \\na resolution recommending that the EMC delay action on the Cities\\' application for \\nat \\nwater supply - to transfer a maximum of 20 million gallons of water per day from the Catawba River. That permit, however, requires both \\n- \\ncounties to decrease or cease their withdrawal from the Catawba River, when necessary to maintain a sufficient flow of water downstream of Lake Wylie. \\nSee Class I Interbasin Transfer Permit, No. 29 WSOl SO2 \\nmay 8, 1989). ', \"least six months. See App. 25, 26-27. That resolution noted South Carolina's opposition to the transfer and of- fered up the Commission as a possible mediator that could enable both States to reach a solution to this interstate dispute through adoption of an interstate compact. \\nSee \\nApp. 27, 29-30. The Commission, however, operates in a \\npurely advisory capacity and has no regulatory authority or any other authority to bind North Carolina or South Carolina. \\nSee App. 26. The EMC ignored the Commis- sion's advisory recommendation, \\nas well as the opposition of South Carolina, and granted the Cities' application on January 10, 2007. \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, and the transfers from the Catawba River authorized under \\nthat \\nstatute, are directly contrary to this Court's decisions with respect to interstate rivers. Those decisions make clear \\nthat North Carolina, as the up-river State, has no right to claim control over the entire flow of the Catawba River, but instead \\nis under a duty to ensure that South Carolina, the down-river State, enjoys the benefits of the Catawba River \\nas well. Because North Carolina has transgressed the bounds of \\nits limited rights under federal law, this \\nCourt should accept jurisdiction over South Carolina's Complaint. Following the full development of the record, the Court should enter \\na decree equitably apportioning the Catawba River, declaring North Carolina's interbasin statute invalid with respect to inequitable transfers out of the Catawba River, and prohibiting \\nall transfers by North Carolina - past and future - that are inconsistent with \\nthat apportionment. To \\nassist in this task, the Court should appoint a Spe- cial Master, \\nas has been its customary practice in equita- ble apportionment cases. \\nA Special Master would be well positioned to compile the record \\nthat is characteristic of \\nthis type of case and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the numerous \", 'factors that this Court considers in applying the doctrine of equitable. apportionment. \\nARGUMENT I. FEDERAL COMMON LAW PRECLUDES RE- SORT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA INTER- BASIN TRANSFER STATUTE FOR RESOLU- TION OF THIS DISPUTE \\nBecause this case \"deal[s] with . . . water in [its] . . . \\ninterstate aspects, there is a federal common law\" that governs this dispute, which is one \"upon which state stat- utes or decisions are not conclusive.\" Illinois \\nv. City of \\nMilwaulzee, 406 U.S. 91, 103, 105 & n.7 (1972). Indeed, this \"federal common law exists\" precisely because \"state law cannot be used\" to resolve disputes between States about the use of an interstate river. City of Milwaukee \\nv. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 n.7 (1981); see also Texas Indus., Inc. \\nv. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641 \\n& n.13 (1981) (recognizing that, in \"interstate water dis- putes,\" \"federal common law applies\" and \"our federal sys- tem does not permit the controversy to be resolved under state law\"); Hinderlider \\nv. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 108-10 (1938) (holding that \"nei- ther the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive\" of the equitable apportionment under federal common law of an interstate river). The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute \"cannot be used\" and is therefore irrelevant to the adjudication of this dispute. Instead, this case must be settled under federal common law, \\n\"on the basis of equality of right,\" recognizing the \"equal level or plane on which all the States stand.\" Connecticut \\nv. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 670-71 (1931) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 97- 100 (1907). As \\na result, the transfers from the Catawba River that North Carolina has previously approved cannot be presumed to be part of North Carolina\\'s equitable share and North Carolina\\'s statute should be declared invalid to the extent that \\nit authorizes transfers in excess of North Carolina\\'s ', 'equitable apportionment as determined by federal com- mon law. Under this Court\\'s settled precedent, North Carolina has the burden of \\n\"present[ing] clear and convincing evidence in support of [those] \\ndiversion[s].\" \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310, 316 (19S4).7 \\n11. SOUTH CAROLINA IS ENTITLED TO AN EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT OF THE \\nCATA\\'WBA RIVER, AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE ENJOINED FROM AUTHORIZING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIVER THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT APPORTION- MENT \\nThis Court has repeatedly held that \"[flederal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring that the water \\nis equitably apportioned between the States and that neither State harms the other\\'s interest in the river.\" Virginia \\nv. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 74 n.9 (2003); see also Kansas \\nv. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 95-98. At the \"root of the doctrine is the same principle that animates many of the Court\\'s Commerce Clause cases: a State may not pre- serve solely for its own inhabitants natural resources lo- cated within \\nits borders.\" Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017, 1025 (1983). Instead, \"States have an af- firmative duty under the doctrine of equitable apportion- ment to take reasonable steps to conserve and even to augment the natural resources within their borders for the benefit of other States.\" Id. The North Carolina interbasin transfer statute, as drafted and applied by the North Carolina EMC, runs di- rectly contrary to those principles. As shown above, the See Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 317 (explaining that where, as here, the downstream State \"has met its initial burden of showing \\'real or substantial injury,\"\\' the \"burden \\nshift[sI7\\' to the up- \\nstream State \"to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that reason- able conservation measures could compensate for some or all of the proposed diversion and that the injury, if any, to [the downstream State] would be outweighed by the benefits to [the upstream State] from the diversion\") (quoting \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. 176, 187 \\nn.13 (1982)). ', 'statute gives no meaningful consideration to South Caro- \\n* lina\\'s uses and users of water that is transferred out of one interstate river basin and into another river basin within North Carolina. See \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 5 143- \\n215.22I(f). Moreover, the statute makes no provision for accommodating the competing needs of both States in the event of drought conditions or other \\nwater supply prob- lems. On the contrary, the statute contemplates \\nthat \\nthe EMC will approve increased intrastate transfers to respond to such conditions, even though such transfers will necessarily reduce the water available to flow downstream to South Carolina. See \\nid. § 143-2 15.22I(j). \\nThis Court has long rejected the principle, implicit in North Carolina\\'s interbasin transfer regime, that \"a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in [an] interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice \\nthat this may work to others having rights \\nin the stream below her boundary.\" Wyoming \\nv. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 466 (1922). Instead, \\nthis Court has repeatedly enforced the rule of equitable apportionment, which \\n\"is directed at ameliorat- ing present harm and preventing future injuries to the complaining State.\" Idaho ex \\nrel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. \\nat 1028. The history of droughts and inconsistent flow \\nthat characterizes the Catawba River demonstrates that North Carolina\\'s assertion of authority to transfer tens of millions of gallons of water daily out of the \\nCa- \\ntawba River - and the threat of further transfers in the future - imposes a serious and direct harm on South Carolina and \\nits citizens. See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 610 (1945) (\"deprivation of water in . . . semiarid regions cannot help but be injurious,\" particularly where there \\nis \"inadequacy of the supply of water to meet all \\nappropriative rights\"). South Carolina has an important sovereign interest in preventing the harms caused by North Carolina\\'s appropriations of water. See, \\ne.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 182 n.9. South Caro- lina also possesses \\na significant parens patriae interest to ', 'protect her citizens from those same harms. See, e.g., \\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. at 616. South Carolina, therefore, respectfully invokes \\nthis \\nCourt\\'s jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with North Caro- lina by equitably apportioning the Catawba River. \\n111. THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT A SPECLAL MASTER \\nAs the Court has commonly done in equitable appor- tionment cases, \\nit should appoint a Special Master to take evidence and make \\na recommendation of the equitable apportionment of the Catawba \\nRiver.8 Equitable ap- portionment \"calls for the exercise of \\nan informed judg- ment on a consideration of many factors.\" Nebraska \\nv. \\nWyoming, 325 U.S. at 618. In Nebraska, this Court pro- vided \"an illustrative not an exhaustive catalogue\" of \"relevant factors,\" which included: physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, \\'the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if \\na limitation is imposed on the former. Id.; see also Colorado \\nv. New Mexico, 459 U.S. at 186-87 (listing factors); Colorado \\nv. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 385 \\n(1943) (same); Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. at \\n670-71 (same). Unsurprisingly, in light of the multi- faceted inquiry involved, cases in which this Court \\nhas \\nequitably apportioned interstate rivers have involved submission of \"voluminous evidence \\n.\"9 \\nSee, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Idaho ex rel. \\nEvans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. at 1018; Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 609 (1983); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 \\nU.S. at 591,617. \\nE.g., Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U.S. 584, 593 (1993); accord, e.g., \\nColorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. at 313; Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 \\nU.S. at 471; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. at 105. ', 'Indeed, this Court routinely \"appoint[s] a Special Mas- ter to develop the record\" when the record \\nas presented in an original action \\n\"is not sufficiently developed to permit [the Court] to address the merits.\" South Carolina \\nv. \\nRegan, 465 U.S. 367, 382 (1984) (plurality); see also United States \\nv.

This proposed transfer would adversely affect the water quantity and quality in both the SC portions of the Catawba River and the Pee Dee River. Ultimately, the IBT would impair the affected \\nSC communities\\' ability to sustain future population growth, to attract new industry and maintain current businesses, to provide adequate drinking water, protect the local wildlife, and accommodate recreation. Access to clean water \\nis directly linked to the vitality of these South Carolina communities. There should be \\nbi- \\nstate participation and cooperation regarding such fun- damentally important decisions which affect both North and South Carolina water rights. Both states, together, should develop a basin wide water management plan \\nin \\norder to facilitate responsible and mutually beneficial water resource allocation. For \\nNC\\'s Environmental ', 'Management Commission (\"EMC\") to unilaterally grant the proposed \\nConcord/Kannapolis IBT without addressing the needs and rights of \\nSC would be detrimental to future cooperation between the two states with respect to water resource management. \"(f) In determining whether a certificate may be \\nis- \\nsued for the transfer, the Commission shall specifi- cally consider each of the following items and state in writing \\nits findings of fact with regard to each item: (2) The present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin, including present and future effects on public, industrial, and agricultural water sup- ply needs, wastewater assimilation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, and recreation. Local water supply plans that affect the source major river basin shall be used to evaluate the projected future municipal water needs in the source major river basin.\" (2a) The cumulative effect on the source major river basin of any water transfer or consump- tive water use that, at the time the Commis- sion considers the application for a certificate is occurring, is authorized under this section, or is projected in any local water supply plan that has been submitted to the Department in accordance with \\nG.S. 143-355(Z). \\n(3) The detrimental effects on the receiving river basin, including effects on water quality, wastewater assimilation, fish and wildlife habitat, navigation, recreation, and flooding \\n79 ... ', 'Importantly, the EIS does not even mention the effects (detrimental or otherwise) on the downstream communi- ties, users or municipalities in South Carolina. The FEIS submitted to the EMC \\nis required to consider, according to N.C.G.S.A. \\n5 143-2 15.22I(f)(2) \"present and reasonably foreseeable future detrimental effects on the source river basin \\n. . .\" However, it fails to do so, completely omitting any mention of effects on the Catawba River Basin in SC. \\nIt also fails to say anything with respect to effects on riverways, instead focusing solely on effects to lakes. Further, the effects to lakes is based on the model used by Duke Power in their current FERC relicensing proposal which has not been finalized. Therefore, the parameters relied upon for the purposes of the FEIS may have changed by the time the Duke FERC relicense is approved. In Section \\n(f)(2a) of the statute, the EMC is required to consider the cumulative effect that this IBT would have on the river system. In order to address this, the FEIS would need to look at future \\nIBTs within the Catawba and \\nYadkinIPee Dee basins and to examine projected popula- tion growth along these systems both down and upstream, including population and industry growth in South Carolina. Section (g) of the statute states: \"(g) \\nA certificate shall be granted for a water trans- fer if the applicant establishes and the Commission concludes by a preponderance of the evidence based upon the findings of fact made under subsection (f) of this section that: (i) the benefits of the proposed transfer \\'outweigh the detriments of the proposed transfer, and (ii) the detriments have been or will be mitigated to a reasonable degree. The conditions necessary to ensure that the detriments are and con- tinue to be mitigated to a reasonable degree shall be attached to the certificate in accordance with sub- section \\n(h) of this section.\" ', 'This section thus requires that benefits of the proposed IBT outweigh the detriments of the proposed IBT and that the detriments of the IBT be mitigated. The EIS does not accurately establish that the benefits of the pro- posed IBT outweigh the detriments because it does not address adverse impacts to South Carolina Riparian own- ers, to community growth, to drinking water supply, or to local environments in South Carolina. Instead, the FEIS focuses upon effect on lake levels based on the previously mentioned, as yet approved, Duke FERC relicense model- ing parameters. This analysis simply does not comply with the statute. Further, the FEIS does not explore in the slightest miti- gation in the Catawba Basin at all but only discusses mitigation efforts to be taken in the Rocky River \\nSub- \\nbasin., i.e. the receiving basin. Section (m) of the statute states: \"(m) It is the public policy of the State to maintain, protect, and enhance water quality within North Carolina. Further, it is the public policy of the State that the cumulative impact of transfers from \\na \\nsource river basin shall not result in a violation of the antidegradation policy set out in 40 Code of Fed- eral \\nRegulations 6 131.12 (1 July 1997 Edition) and the statewide antidegradation policy adopted pursu- ant thereto.\" The portion of the Federal Clean Water Act mentioned in section \\n(m) of the statute deals with degradation of wa- ters, which the proposed IBT would violate. (40 CFR \\n5131.12) This section states (in part): \"(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and \\nidentifjr the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following: ', '(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the exist- ing uses shall be maintained and protected. \\n(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed lev- els necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained \\nand protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordina- tion and public participation provisions of the State\\'s continuing planning process, that al- lowing lower water quality \\nis necessary to ac- commodate important economic or social de- velopment in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and exist- ing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. \\n(3) Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such \\nas waters of National and State parks and wildlife ref- uges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.\" The proposed IBT would significantly degrade the waters of SC in terms of water quantity, as well as water quan- tity, in violation of the Clean Water Act\\'s antidegredation requirements. The FEIS does not discuss mitigation for such degradation to South Carolina waters as federal law requires. B. Water rights in North and South Carolina are based in the common law principle of Riparian Rights. This ', \"doctrine is rooted in the concept of reasonable use of wa- \\n' ter by landowners adjacent to the waterway. SC contends that the proposed IBT would interfere with the reasonable use of the water of \\nits riparian owners within the Ca- \\ntawba basin while at the same time conferring a benefit on nonriparian owners in the Ricky River Subbasin. C. Further, for the North Carolina Environmental Man- agement Commission unilaterally to reach a decision which will ultimately affect commerce within South Caro- \\nlina is in violation of the United States Constitution, arti- cle \\nI, section 3 which delegates regulation of interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress. Clearly, the proposed IBT would effect SC7s ability to maintain current infra- structure, attract new business, support growth in popu- lation and our economy, and encourage tourism. Conclusion The proposed IBT would surely have a detrimental effect upon the economy of SC, our ability to grow and attract new industry, upon the health and vitality of our wildlife, upon recreation and tourism and upon the health and public safety of the citizens of South Carolina. \\nIn our view, the proposed IBT contravenes federal statutes \\nas \\nwell as the Federal Constitution. We urge rejection of the proposed \\nIBT. \\nVery Truly Yours, \\nL.

The State of South Carolina submitted comments to the Commission expressing in detail our concerns regarding the adverse impact this transfer would have upon South Carolina. Governor Sanford \\nhas expressed in writing his opposition to this interbasin transfer. Our members of Congress from the Catawba and \\nPeeDee regions have likewise expressed their opposition. South Carolina does not believe the current process by which such \\na transfer is \\ngranted exclusively by North Carolina authorities treats South Carolina's interests and water users \\nin accordance with governing legal principles. \\nThis office has recently been approached by public offi- cials and citizens throughout the Catawba and Wateree River area urging us to take whatever legal action \\nis nec- essary to protect South Carolina's interests and rights. We are preparing to do so. One such option \\nis litigation in the original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme \", \"Court, a process which can take many years, as witnessed by the boundary dispute between Georgia and South Carolina which consumed more than ten years. There \\nis an alternative to litigation. The North Caro- lina Environmental Management Commission could sus- pend \\nits ongoing IBT proceedings concerning the Concord- \\nKannapolis transfer while officials of North and South Carolina seek to negotiate an interstate compact address- ing this issue, along with other water issues. Such a com- pact would have to be approved by the two states' legisla- tures and probably by the United States Congress \\nas well. Our reaching an agreement concerning water disputes and related issues would be wiser and less costly to the taxpayers than litigating each question \\nas it arises. As the Southeast grows, unprecedented water questions will likely arise with increasing frequency. \\nA delay in plan- ning could have serious consequences. Even if the EMC were to turn down the request from Concord and Kannapolis, we will \\nstill need to address these issues \\nas outlined above.

Frampton \\nDirector \\nMay 31, 2007 \\nSummary of Catawba-Wateree River basin natural flows and the impact of water transfers from that basin in North Carolina \\nThere is usually more than enough water in the Ca- tawba River to meet the needs of \\nall of its water users in South Carolina, but even with responsible and cooperative reservoir management, there will be times when the \\nCa- \\ntawba River does not have enough water in it to meet South Carolina's needs. During most years, this condition may occur for only \\na few days if at all, but during drought years, this condition may occur for months \\nat a time. In- \\nterbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba basin in North Carolina will reduce the amount of water in the river. Most of the time, there will be ample water in the system so \\nthat water transfers out of the basin will not be harmful to South Carolina, but there will be times when there \\nis not enough water in the Catawba River to meet South Carolina's needs, and during those times, water transfers out of the basin in North Carolina will have \\na \\ndetrimental effect on the Catawba River in South Caro- \\nlina. \\nDuke Energy owns and operates a system of eleven res- ervoirs in the Catawba-Wateree basin of North and South Carolina. Six lakes are located entirely \\nin North Caro- lina, four lakes are located within South Carolina, and Lake Wylie \\nis situated on the North Carolina-South Caro- lina border. Because the six lakes located entirely \\nin \\nNorth Carolina all drain into Lake Wylie, the outflow or discharge from Lake Wylie can serve \\nas an indicator of how much water \\nis flowing into South Carolina via the \\nCatawba River. \", \"As part of its recent FERC relicensing process, Duke Energy developed \\na water mass balance model to simulate conditions in its \\n11 lakes and the rivers that connect them within the Catawba-Wateree basin. Part of this model included developing natural water inflows for the basin for \\n75 years from 1929 through 2003, to simulate hydro- logic conditions \\nas if the lakes were not there. Results of the Duke Energy model were used to develop water allo- cation strategies for \\nall users in the basin and to reach a \\nformal agreement in the FERC license guaranteeing spe- cific minimum continuous discharges from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River in South Carolina. The minimum continuous flow requirement agreed to in the FERC license calls for the release of 1,100 cfs (cubic feet per second) from Lake Wylie into the Catawba River. The minimum continuous flow will be provided by a com- bination of leakage, spillage, and generation from the Lake Wylie dam. Using data from \\nthe Duke Energy hydrologic model, the natural average daily flow of the Catawba River \\nat the location of the Lake Wylie Dam was compared to the minimum continuous flow requirement (1,100 cfs) from Lake Wylie for the period 1930-2002. Table \\n1 shows the number of days per year in which the natural river flow \\nat \\nthe Lake Wylie Dam would have been less than 1,100 cfs. For example, during the year 2002 - after years of drought - the natural inflow into Lake Wylie would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 104 days. When enough water \\nis stored in the lakes, natural inflow can be supplemented . \\nto meet required flows. However, during periods of water shortage and consecutive dry years, low lake levels may make supplemental water unavailable. \\nIt is clear that \\nduring severe or prolonged droughts (such as in the mid- \\n195OYs, the late 1980's, and 1998-2002) there would be many days in which there will not be enough water in the basin to meet the required 1,100 cfs release from Lake Wylie. \", 'The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a streamflow gaging station on the Catawba River just below Lake Wylie since 1942. This gage provides measured daily flows of the Catawba River, and because \\nit is located 3.5 \\nmiles downstream of the Lake Wylie Dam, it provides a \\ngood measure of the releases from Lake Wylie, which has been in existence since 1904. Data from this gage indicate \\nthat daily average releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs for many days of each year (Table \\n2), and during drought years, that number usually exceeds 100 days. The impact of a severe drought on the Catawba River can be seen in Figure \\n1, which shows the measured daily flow of the river just below Lake Wylie in the year 2001. Releases from Lake Wylie were less than 1,100 cfs on 205 days of that year, even though Table \\n1 indicates that the \"natural\" flow of the river \\nat this location would have been less than 1,100 cfs for 70 days during \\nthat year. The actual flow of the river was much less than what \\nit natu- rally would have been because some water was removed from the river for offstream uses, such \\nas public supplies, and some water was lost to evaporation, but mainly be- cause lake operators did not release \\nas much water from their lakes \\nas flowed into them. With lake levels already low and no idea of how much longer the drought would last, lake managers tried to retain as much water \\nas pos- sible for as long \\nas possible, at the expense of downstream releases. The Catawba River can experience very low flows \\nat \\nany time of the year, not just during the dry summer and fall months. Table \\n3, which lists the lowest measured daily average flow for each day of the year for the gage\\'s 64-year period of record, shows \\nthat daily average flows of less than 1,100 cfs occurred on \\nall but two days of the year. For example, the lowest flow of the Catawba River \\nat this gage on any January 6 during the period of record was 562 cfs, and the lowest flow on any January \\n7 during the period of record was 132 cfs (which occurred on ', \"January 7, 2002, and is also the lowest outflow ever re- \\ncorded from Lake Wylie). This information indicates that natural hydrologic con- ditions can cause insufficient flows in the Catawba River \\nat any time of the year, and during severe droughts, the minimum flow requirement of 1,100 cfs may not be met for months at \\na time. Hydrologic conditions can result in periods when the basin does not have enough water to maintain the Catawba River at even minimally adequate flows, and during these times, transfers of even relatively small volumes of water out of the basin in North Carolina will further reduce the Catawba River flow, increasing the hardship for water users in South Carolina and prolong- ing the time that the river's flow will be less than 1,100 cfs \\n. \\nAccording to the South Carolina Water Plan - 2nd Edi- tion, trigger mechanisms should be established within \\na \\nbasin to reduce or restrict water transfers out of that ba- sin when water availability becomes reduced to the point that there \\nis not enough water to meet required stream- \\nflows or the water-use needs of all users within the donor basin. Applying this concept to the Catawba-Wateree ba- sin, \\nall water transfers out of the basin should be reduced \\nas discharges from Lake Wylie approach 1,100 cfs, and all transfers should cease completely if discharges from Lake Wylie fall to 1,100 cfs or less. The State Water Plan also promotes the concept of managing water allocation within an entire basin using \\na \\ncomprehensive plan that involves the entire basin, re- gardless of political boundaries. A commission or compact should be created to manage and allocate \\nall the water in \\nthe Catawba- Wateree basin. \", 'Table 1.

The Lake Wylie Marina is located on Highway 49 \\nS. at Buster Boyd Bridge, Lake Wylie, in York County, South Carolina. \\n5. The Lake Wylie Marina is a seven-acre, full service marina located on the shores of Lake Wylie. \\n6. In addition to operating as a marine retail opera- tion, Lake Wylie Marina has \\n82 wet slips, approximately \\n400 dry storage slips, and a marine repair business. ', '7. The Lake Wylie marina is located adjacent to \\nthe Buster Boyd Access Area, a facility on Lake Wylie containing four public use boat ramps for the purpose of allowing the public to launch boats into Lake Wylie. \\n8. Many people that use the Buster Boyd Access Area \\nutilize the facilities of Lake Wylie Marina to purchase \\n. food, fuel, and other services. \\n9. The dry storage operation consists of large build- ings where boats are stacked \\nin racks. To launch these boats \\nat a customer\\'s request, forklifts are used to lift the boats from the storage racks. The forklifts then carry the boats to \\nlakeside facilities (the \"Forklift Facilities\") where the forklifts lower the boats into the water. 10. Lake Wylie is a reservoir located \\nin the Catawba River basin and water flows in the Catawba River are critical to the lake levels of Lake Wylie during periods of low precipitation. 11. During the summer of 2002, the water levels of Lake Wylie dropped precipitously as the result of drought conditions. As the result of the drops in lake levels (the following are referred to jointly as the \"Impacts\"): a. Duke Energy closed the ramps in the Buster Boyd Access Area for several months because low water levels destroyed the ability of people to launch safely. their boats into Lake Wylie. Closing the ramps had a direct financial impact on Lake Wylie Marina by reducing the flow of customers from the Buster Boyd Access Area to the Lake Wylie Marina. b. Approximately two thirds of the wet slips at. Lake Wylie Marina could not be used for approximately three months. c. Boats stored in the dry storage facilities could ndt be launched because \\n1ake.levels were too low for the Forklift Facilities to be used for approximately one month. d. Lake Wylie Marina lost customers for \\nits wet slips and its dry storage facilities because the wet slips ', 'EXHIBIT 6 \\nNo- -, Original \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, Plaintiff, v. \\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, Defendant.

I have worked at the Catawba Plant as Environ- mental Manager since May 200 1. \\n4. I am familiar with the impacts of the drought of \\n2002 on the Catawba Plant. \\n5. The Catawba Plant: \\na. Was established in 1957. \\nb. Is one of the largest coated paper and market pulp mills \\nin the world and is the largest in \\nNorth America. ', 'c. Has an annual capacity of 649,000 metric tons of coated paper and 245,000 metric tons of market pulp. \\n6. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations South Carolina\\'s 2004 Manufacturer of the Year. In 2005, Industry Week Maga- zine in association with the National Association of Manu- facturers \\n(NAM) named Bowater\\'s Catawba Operations a \"Best Plants\" award winner. \\n7. The Catawba Operation employs approximately 1,000 employees. \\n8. From 2003 through 2005, the Catawba Operation \\nhas received capital improvements that included the con- struction of \\na $175 million state-of-the-art kraft-pulping mill, along with a $106 million paper machine conversion. \\n9. The Catawba Plant is dependent on water as a re- source that \\nis temporarily removed from the Catawba River and used in plant operations that \\nis then returned to the Catawba River in treated form. \\n10. When operating at full capacity, the Catawba Plant uses approximately 30 million gallons per day of water from the Catawba River that \\nis returned to the Ca- \\ntawba River after appropriate treatment. \\n11. For the Catawba Plant to operate efficiently, the Catawba River (a) must be high enough to cover the plant intakes located on the Catawba River and \\n(b) flowing at a \\nrate adequate to receive the water discharges from the Catawba Plant within \\nthe limits of the Catawba River\\'s assimilative capacity at the discharge point. 12. During one of the worst droughts on record, from 1998 to \\n2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and the lack of water threatened the operations of the Catawba \\nPlant. \\n13. The reduced flows in the Catawba River from 1998 - 2002 reduced the assimilative capacity of the Catawba River \\nat the Catawba Plant such that the Catawba \\nPlant was forced to severely limit its discharge into the ', 'Catawba River because there was not enough flow to as- \\nsimilate treated wastewater at the limits prescribed by its \\nstate permit. As a result, the Catawba Plant had to util- ize on-site holding ponds for wastewater and incur extra wastewater treatment costs in excess of \\n$6000/day to maintain production. By late 2002, the Catawba Plant was close to reaching holding pond capacity. \\nIf holding pond capacity had been reached, the Catawba Plant would have had to potentially curtail production which would have likely caused significant financial loss to Bowater and forced layoffs due to the cessation of plant operations. \\n14. Transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin in the State of North Carolina mean less water \\nis avail- able in the Catawba River to meet the requirements of the Catawba Plant operations. \\nIS/ DALE HERENDEEN \\nDale Herendeen, Environmental Manager Sworn to and Subscribed before me this 30 day of May, 2007 \\nIS/ Donna Uebler [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires February \\n3, 2010.

I am the Catawba Riverkeeper and the Executive Director of the \\nCatawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\"). \\n2. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit environ- mental organization. \\n3. 1 have been the Catawba Riverkeeper since 1998. \\n4. 1 received a Bachelors of Science from Clemson \\nUniversity in 1987. \\n5. The mission of the Foundation is to advocate for and secure \\nprotection and enhancement of the Catawba River, \\nits lakes, tributaries and watershed so that it will always \\nsustain the human and wildlife populations that depend on \\nit for life. \\n6. 1 am -personally familiar with the Catawba River from \\nits origins in the State of North Carolina until its \\nterminus in the State of South Carolina. ', \"7. The statements and opinions set forth'in this affi- davit are based on my experiences working \\nas the Ca- \\ntawba Riverkeeper, including participation in rulemaking and legislative processes, patrolling the river, studying and commenting on permits and developments proposed within the basin, reading studies, documents and other materials, and involvement in \\na variety of other matters that have an effect on the Catawba River and its environs, and the aquatic life \\nit supports. \\n8. Part of my job as the Catawba Riverkeeper is to patrol the entire reach of the Catawba River, including the various reservoirs created by dams in the Catawba River, in the States of North Carolina and South Caro- lina, both by boat and by vehicle. \\n9. The Catawba River basin, in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina: a. Contains \\n13 hydro stations b. Contains \\n11 reservoirs c. Spans over 362 km of river d. Has a total drainage area of approximately 2888 km of reservoir and island shoreline e. Flows through nine counties in North Carolina and five counties in South Carolina f. \\nHas a total drainage area of 12,302.5 square kms g. Provides a drinking water supply for over \\n1.3 mil- lion people whose needs are projected to increase over 200% in the next 50 years h. Provides the energy to power 116,000 homes and the water to support over \\n8100MW of fossil and nuclear-fueled power plants 10. There \\nis an intricate set of dependencies on the \\nCatawbdWateree River system, all hinging upon the deli- cate balance of water use both now and in the future. Jobs, communities, industry, recreation, and the envi- ronment are \\nat stake. \", '11. The water flows of the Catawba River vary widely from season to season and year to year. For example, the United States Geological Survey has reported the follow- ing data for the Catawba River at their stream gauge lo- cated on the Catawba River Near Rock Hill, SC: \\n12. As Catawba Riverkeeper, \\nI meet with stake- holders, interested parties, and representatives of state agencies about issues of concern about the Catawba River. \\n13. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I have participated on behalf of the Foundation \\nas a stakeholder in the ongoing negotiations (the \"FERC Negotiations\") between Duke Power Company LLC, doing business \\nas Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (\"Duke\") and other stakeholders related to the renewal of various Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission (\"FERC\") licenses for various reservoirs located on the Catawba River \\nthat are held by Duke. 14. The FERC Negotiations resulted in certain agree- ments with regard to the FERC Licenses that are set forth in that certain Comprehensive Relicensing Agree- ment for the Catawba-Wateree Hydro Project FERC Pro- ject No. 2232 effective \\nas of August 1, 2006 (the \"Relicens- \\ning Agreement\").

I am familiar with the terms of the Relicensing Agreement. \\n16. The Relicensing Agreement has been filed with the FERC. \\n17. As Catawba Riverkeeper and through participation in the FERC Negotiations, \\nI am familiar with the proto- cols related to river flows, particularly the low in flow pro- tocols (the \"LI Protocols\") and how the LI Protocols are implemented and the effect that removing water from the Catawba River has on the frequency of implementation of the \\nLI Protocols, particularly in times of drought. \\n18. The Catawba River begins in the mountains of North Carolina near Mount Mitchell and on \\nits 225 mile course to South Carolina \\nis dammed 11 times creating the following reservoirs: Lake James, Lake Rhodhiss, Lake Hickory, Lake Lookout Shoals, Lake Norman, Mountain Island Lake, Lake Wylie, Fishing Creek Lake, Great \\nFalls \\nLake, Rocky Creek Lake and Lake Wateree. \\n19. As Catawba Riverkeeper, I am familiar with vari- ous issues impacting the Catawba River, including, but not limited to (a) water quality, \\n(b) water quantity, (c) his- \\ntoric streamflow patterns and their impacts on the users of the Catawba River, (d) historic reservoir levels and their impact on the users of the Catawba River and \\nits \\nassociated lakes, (e) development both within and along the shores of the Catawba River, (f) industrial develop- ment along the Catawba River, (g) current populations and predicted growth along the Catawba River corridor, \\n(h) the flora and fauna found in and appurtenant to the Catawba River, (i) current and predicted demand for the waters of the Catawba River, \\n(j) the issues with regard to the impacts and potential impacts of interbasin transfers of the waters of the Catawba River to other river basins, and \\n(k) the impact of the LI Protocols, particularly in time of drought. \\n20. The Catawba River basin has one of the fastest growing populations in the States of North and South Carolina. The largest city in North and South Carolina \\nis ', 'Charlotte, NC. It is located in the Catawba River Basin. The greater Charlotte region added approximately 300,000 residents from 2000 to 2006 or the equivalent of twice the population of Asheville, North Carolina. 21. The consequences of interbasin transfers of water out of the Catawba River basin by the upstream State of North Carolina reach through the agency of natural laws into the territory of the State of South Carolina because the flow of the Catawba River \\nis reduced. The natural consequences of such interbasin transfers impact the State of South Carolina by lowering the quantity of water in the Catawba River that flows into the State of South Carolina. 22. During one of the worst droughts on record, from \\n1998 to 2002, the Catawba River was severely depleted and struggled to meet water demands \\nat the 2002 popula- tion levels. During the last year of the drought, the fol- lowing impacts were recorded (the \"Drought Factors\"): \\na. Algae blooms occurred on Lake Wateree in the State of South Carolina \\nthat caused such taste and odor problems in finished drinking water for the City of \\nCamden, South Carolina that resi- dents stopped drinking tap water and started buying bottled water. b. Most boat landings and public access areas on the Catawba River lakes, in both the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, closed due to low water levels, greatly impacting public recreation and access to these public \\ntrust waters. c. Duke dramatically reduced electricity generation \\nat their thirteen hydroelectric power generation stations located on the Catawba River. d. The Bowater pulp and paper mill in the State of South Carolina was forced to severely limit \\nits \\ndischarge into the Catawba River because there was not enough flow to assimilate treated waste- water at the limits prescribed by \\nits state permit. As \\na result, Bowater had to construct temporary ', 'holding ponds for wastewater, and the plant was within days of reaching holding pond capacity which would have necessitated shut down of one of the State of South Carolina\\'s largest employers. e. Major tributaries of the Catawba River basin, in- cluding Fishing Creek which flows through York and Chester counties in the State of South Caro- lina, were so reduced in flow that the only waters flowing were waters from wastewater treatment discharges. \\n23. The diversion of the waters of the Catawba River in the State of North Carolina into other river basins re- sults, through the agency of natural law, \\nin decreasing the flows into the State of South Carolina and exacerbates the Drought Factors whenever there are drought conditions \\nin \\nthe Catawba River basin. \\n24. The Relicensing Agreement contains certain proto- cols for the reservoir system operated by Duke known \\nas \\nthe \"Low In Flow Protocols\" (the \"LI Protocols\"). As set forth in Appendix C of the Relicensing Agreement with regard to the LI Protocols: \\nLow Inflow Protocol (LIP) for the Catawba-Wateree Project PURPOSE \\nThe purpose of this Low Inflow Protocol (LIP) is to establish. procedures for reductions \\nin water use during periods of low inflow to the Catawba- Wateree Project (the Project). The LIP was devel- oped on the basis that all parties with interests \\nin \\nwater quantity will share the responsibility to es- tablish priorities and to conserve the limited water \\nsupply. \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis Low Inflow Protocol provides trigger points and procedures for how the Catawba-Wateree \\nPro- ', \"ject will be operated by the Licensee [Duke], as well \\nas water withdrawal reduction measures and goals for other water users during periods of low inflow \\n(i.e., periods when there is not enough water flowing into the Project reservoirs to meet the normal water demands while maintaining Remain- ing Usable Storage [defined in the Relicensing Agreement] in the reservoir system \\nat or above a \\nseasonal target level). The Licensee will provide flow from hydro generation and other means to support electric customer needs and the \\ninstream \\nflow needs of the Project. During periods of normal inflow, reservoir levels will be maintained within prescribed Normal Operating Ranges [defined in the Relicensing Agreement]. During times that in- flow \\nis not adequate to meet all of the normal de- mands for water and maintain reservoir levels \\nas \\nnormally targeted the Licensee will progressively reduce hydro generation. If hydrologic conditions worsen until trigger points outlined herein \\nare \\nreached, the Licensee will declare a Stage 0 - Low Inflow Watch and begin meeting with the applica- ble agencies and water users to discuss \\nthis LIP. If hydrologic conditions continue to worsen, the \\nLi- \\ncensee will declare various stages of a Low Inflow Condition (LIC) as defined in the Procedure section of \\nthis document. Each progressive stage of the LIC will call for greater reductions in hydro station releases and water withdrawals, and allow addi- tional use of the available water storage inventory. The goal of \\nthis staged LIP is to take the actions needed \\nin the Catawba-Wateree River Basin to de- lay the point \\nat which the Project's usable water storage inventory \\nis fully depleted. While there are no human actions that can guarantee that the Catawba-Wateree River Basin will never experi- ence operability limitations \\nat water intake struc- \\ntures due to low reservoir levels or low stream- \\nflows, this LIP is intended to provide additional \", \"time to allow precipitation to restore streamflow, reservoir levels, and groundwater levels to normal ranges. The amount of additional time that \\nis \\ngained during the LIP depends primarily on the diagnostic accuracy of the trigger points, the amount of regulatory flexibility the Licensee has to operate the Project, and the effectiveness of the Licensee and other water users in working to- gether to implement their required actions and achieve significant water use reductions in \\na \\ntimely manner. \\n25. All interbasin transfers authorized by the State of North Carolina, including the recent transfer granted to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis that transfer water out of the Catawba River into the \\nYadkin/Pee Dee River Basin, impact and injure the State of South Carolina by: \\na. Affecting both the quality and quantity of water by permanently removing water from the portion of the Catawba River located in the State of North Carolina upstream of the border with the State of South Carolina, making less water avail- able to the State of South Carolina for drinking, recreation, economic development, and waste assimilation. b. Causing an increase in the amount of treated waste water discharged into the \\nYadkidPee Dee Rivers, thereby removing waste assimilation ca- pacity from the South Carolina portion of the Pee Dee River which impacts South Carolina local governments and industries currently depend- ent on the Pee Dee River for drinking water, recreation, economic development and waste assimilation. c. Exacerbating the 'Drought Factors during any pe- riods of drought conditions in the Catawba River basin. \", \"d. Increasing the frequency that LI Protocols under the FERC Licenses will be implemented to the detriment of \\nall stakeholders, including the State of South Carolina, \\nits citizens, its municipalities, and the flora and fauna of the Catawba River. e. Increasing the frequency that the Catawba River Project's usable water storage inventory will be depleted. 26. Based on materials \\nI have read and conditions I \\nhave observed, and the statements made above, it is my opinion \\nthat the Catawba River has reached its threshold for sustainable use. \\nIS/ DONNA LISENBY Donna Lisenby, Catawba Riverkeeper Sworn to and Subscribed before me \\nthis 30th day of May, 2007 \\n/s/ SUSAN ADKINS [notary seal omitted] Notary Public for South Carolina My commission expires 2/27/16. \", '43 \\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Annotated 5 143- \\n215.22G provides: \\n5 143-215.22G.

(k) The substantive restrictions and conditions upon surface water transfers authorized in this section may be imposed pursuant to any federal law that permits the State to certify, restrict, or condition any new or continu- ing transfers or related activities licensed, relicensed, or otherwise authorized by the federal government. \\n(I) When any transfer for which a certificate was issued under \\nthis section equals eighty percent (80%) of the maximum amount authorized in the certificate, the appli- cant shall submit to the Department \\na detailed plan that \\nspecifies how the applicant intends to address future fore- seeable water needs. If the applicant \\nis required to have a local water supply plan, then this plan \\nshall be an amendment to the local water supply plan required by \\nG.S.143-355(1).
